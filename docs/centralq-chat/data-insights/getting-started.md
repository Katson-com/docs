## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure the following conditions are met:

- **CentralQ Chat Installed**: CentralQ Chat must be installed and configured in your Business Central environment. See the [Installation Guide](../installation.md) and [Configuration Guide](../configuration.md).
- **Permissions**:
    - **To configure**: Users need the `GPT CQC - ADMIN` or `GPT CQC - SETUP` permission set
    - **To use**: Users need appropriate permissions to access the Business Central data they want to query
- **Microsoft Entra Application**: A Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure Active Directory) application registration is 
required with the necessary API permissions for Business Central. You will need this application's **Client ID** and a 
generated **Client Secret** during the setup process.
    *   Within your Microsoft Entra application, you must grant API permissions for **Dynamics 365 Business Central**.
    *   The specific permissions required are:
        *   `Financials.ReadWrite.All` (Application Permission)
        *   `User.Read` (Application Permission - often needed for user context)
        *   `user_impersonation` (Delegated Permission - typically for Dynamics 365 Business Central API)

!!! note
    Verify the exact API permissions based on your Business Central version and security requirements.

## Enabling the Data Insights Agent

Once configured, the Data Insights Agent is ready to use.

## Your First Data Query

With the Data Insights Agent active:

1. **Open CentralQ Chat**

2. **Ask Your Question** in natural language. For example:
    - "What were our total sales last month?"
    - "Show me the top 5 customers by revenue in Q1."
    - "List open sales orders for customer 'Contoso'."

3. **Review the Results**:
    - The agent interprets your question
    - Fetches and analyzes the relevant data
    - Presents answers with text and visualizations

## Tips for Effective Queries
To get the best results from the Data Insights Agent:

*   **Be Specific**: The more specific your question, the more accurate the results. For instance, instead of "Show sales," try "Show total sales revenue for item 'X' in January 2024."
*   **Use Known Terms**: While the agent is designed for natural language, using terms that align with your Business Central fields or common business language (e.g., "customer ledger entries," "G/L accounts," "sales orders") can improve understanding.
*   **Start Simple**: If you have a complex query, try breaking it down into simpler questions first.
*   **Iterate**: If the initial response isn't exactly what you need, refine your question and ask again. You can also ask follow-up questions.
