## Available Business Central Data

The Data Insights Agent works with:

- **Standard APIs**: Sales, Purchasing, Inventory, Financials, Customer records, Vendor records, and more.
- **Custom APIs**: If your custom fields or tables are accessible through Business Central APIs, the agent can use this data too, without any additional configuration.

!!! info "Data Access Requirements"
    Two factors determine what data you can analyze:
    
    1. **API Availability**: The data must be accessible through Business Central APIs.
    2. **User Permissions**: You will only see data that your Business Central user account has permission to access.

## Response Format

The Data Insights Agent provides answers in a clear, easy-to-understand format:

- **Text Summaries**: Concise answers that directly address your question.
- **Visualizations**: Automatically generated charts (bar charts, line graphs, pie charts) to help you spot trends and patterns.
- **"Thoughts" Section**: For transparency, you can expand this section to see how the answer was derived, including the code used.
