## Tips for Effective Queries

To get the most from the Data Insights Agent:

1. **Include timeframes**: Specify the time period (e.g., "last quarter," "year to date," "past 6 months")

2. **Mention specific metrics**: Clearly state what you want to measure (sales amount, quantity, profit margin)

3. **Ask for comparisons**: Request comparative analysis (e.g., "compared to same period last year")

4. **Specify visualization types**: Request specific chart types if needed (e.g., "show me a trend line")

5. **Use follow-up questions**: Build on initial queries to explore further

## Follow-up Question Examples

Initial: "Show me sales by region for this year"

Effective follow-ups:

- "Which product categories are driving the growth in the Western region?"
- "Compare the customer retention rate between our top and bottom performing regions"
- "What's the profit margin difference between regions?"
