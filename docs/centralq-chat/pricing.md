CentralQ offers two distinct tiers tailored to meet diverse user needs – the feature-rich CentralQ Chat and the accessible [CentralQ.ai](http://www.centralq.ai).

### CentralQ Chat

Unlock the full potential of CentralQ Chat with our paid version. Designed for those who seek a comprehensive, integrated experience with Business Central. CentralQ Chat now includes advanced page scripting capabilities, allowing users to import, manage, and automate workflows directly from YAML files or links, seamlessly integrating detailed script-based interactions into the knowledgebase. The Data Insights Agent feature enables natural language data analysis with visualizations, transforming how you interact with your Business Central data.

### CentralQ.ai

Explore [CentralQ.ai](http://www.centralq.ai) – a perfect free starting point for users who prefer access to public knowledge bases without the depth of integration offered in the paid version.
