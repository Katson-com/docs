CentralQ Chat, while being a powerful tool for instant information retrieval about Microsoft Business Central, operates within certain limitations that users should be aware of.

### Limitations in Data Access and Functionality

- **No Direct Business Central Data Access**: CentralQ Chat does not have the capability to directly access or interact with your Business Central data. It cannot provide insights or analyses based on your specific Business Central data.
- **Cannot Execute Business Central Functions**: The chat cannot perform actions or run functions within Business Central. It is solely an informational tool.

### AI-Generated Content and Accuracy

- **Potential for Inaccuracies**: While AI strives for accuracy, it can occasionally generate incorrect or misleading information. This is an inherent limitation of current AI technology.
- **Need for Fact-Checking**: Always cross-reference AI responses with cited sources. The AI might "hallucinate" or present information out of context.
- **Variability in Response Quality**: The quality and accuracy of responses can vary based on the question's complexity and the available knowledge base.

### Contextual Limitations

- **Context Window Constraint**: The AI operates with a context length of 4096 tokens, encompassing the input, system prompt, retrieved information, chat history, and the response. This limitation can impact the continuity and relevance of responses in prolonged interactions.
- **Session-Based Interaction**: Each chat session is designed to address a specific topic or user intent. Switching topics mid-session may lead to less coherent responses.

### Links to Business Central pages
- Currently, CentralQ Chat does not support links to Business Central pages. This feature will be added in a future releases.
